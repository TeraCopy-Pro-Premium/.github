## What is TeraCopy?

**TeraCopy** is a highly-efficient and popular file transfer utility designed for Microsoft Windows. It replaces the standard copy and move functions of the operating system, providing significantly faster speeds, enhanced reliability, and greater control over file operations. Unlike the built-in Windows Explorer copy dialog, which can be slow and prone to freezing, especially with large files or problematic drives, TeraCopy uses dynamically adjusted buffers to reduce seek times and accelerate the transfer process.

It is an indispensable tool for IT professionals, content creators, and anyone who regularly works with large volumes of data. TeraCopy seamlessly integrates into the shell context menu, making it a natural part of your workflow. Its robust error recovery feature allows it to skip problematic files and complete the transfer of all other data, presenting you with the failed files list at the end instead of stopping the entire operation. Furthermore, it can verify copied files against their checksums to ensure data integrity is perfectly maintained.
